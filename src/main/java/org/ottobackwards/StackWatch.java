/**
 * The StackWatch class, along with the {@code TimeRecordNode} provide a wrapper around the
 * Apache Commons StopWatch class.
 * <p>
 * While the {@code StopWatch} provides functionality to time the length of operations, there is no
 * context or name to go with the time tracked.
 * </p>
 * It is not possible to time nested calls with the {@code StopWatch} as well.
 * <p>
 * This class provides that functionality, allowing successive calls to startTime to track nested
 * calls.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Each start provides a name, thus providing context to the timing.
 * </p>
 * At the end of a timing 'run', a visitor interface provides the ability to visit all the timing
 * 'nodes' and capture thier output.
 * <p>
 * The {@code TimeRecordNodes} provide a tree structure in support of nesting.
 * A {@code Deque} is use to track the current time node.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *   This class is not thread safe, and is meant to track timings across multiple calls on the same
 *   thread
 * </p>
